<h3><a name="what"></a>What is ILLiad?</a></h3>

<p>ILLiad is the electronic system you use to request an item through Interlibrary 
  Loan. The name ILLiad can be thought of as an acronym for <strong><u>I</u></strong>nter<strong><u>L</u></strong>ibrary 
  <strong><u>L</u></strong>oan <strong><u>i</u></strong>nternet <strong><u>a</u></strong>ccessible 
  <strong><u>d</u></strong>atabase. WSU Pullman affiliates away from Pullman use 
  the ILLiad request forms for all research material needs that cannot be met 
  by requesting loaned material through Griffin or <a href="http://128.223.84.85/">Summit</a>.

<h3><a name="better"></a>How is ILLiad better than traditional ILL systems?</h3>

<ol>
  <li>You will find it easier to submit your interlibrary loan requests. With ILLiad, you
    enter your name, address, and other personal information into the system only once, when you <a href="firsttime.html">register with ILLiad</a>.</li>
  <li>Your request will be handled more rapidly and accurately as problems relating to
    misinterpretation of hand-written requests are eliminated.</li>
  <li>You can get many of your photocopies more quickly through Electronic
    Delivery.</li>
  <li>You can get information about the status of your request through the Web at any time
    from any location simply by logging in to your ILLiad account. </li>
  <li>Library personnel are able to serve you better because all data about your request and
    its handling is stored in a searchable database. We are able to respond quickly to your
    inquiries about your request. We are also able to gather statistical information about the
    performance of the libraries that lend to us, enabling us to make better decisions when
    choosing a lender to supply an item.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="disadvantage"></a>Are there any disadvantages to the
electronic system?</h3>

<p>Some people might find it troublesome to have to log into ILLiad using a username and
password. We believe this is less trouble than traditional paper and electronic systems
which require you to enter your personal information with each new request.</p>

<h5><a href="#contents" target="_self">Back to Top</a></h5>

<hr>

<h3><a name="userid"></a>Why do I need a username and password to use
ILLiad?</h3>

<p>Your username and password provides you with secure access to information about
your interlibrary loan requests. You can also edit your personal information
such as your address or phone number. </p>

<p>Your username can be anything you like, such as your name, abbreviations, or an
alphanumeric code. Your password also can be anything you like. We recommend that you
follow good security practice and choose a password that is different from those you use
to access other systems. However, no one but you will know your password, not even the
library staff. The password you set is stored in an encrypted file. When you register, you may choose to have a password hint in case you forget your password.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="password"></a>What if I forget my password?</h3>

<p>In the event that you forget your password, please contact the Interlibrary Loan Office
at (509) 335-5517. We can then reset your password allowing you access to ILLiad. Please
change your password once you logon to ILLiad.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="webbrowser"></a>What Web browser should I use?</h3>

<p>You need a Web browser that can handle forms, tables, and, preferably, one that can
handle frames.&nbsp; We recommend
either Netscape Navigator version 6.0 or greater or Microsoft Internet Explorer version
5.0 or greater. Both browsers are available for the Windows 3.x, Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP or NT, and
Macintosh O/S operating systems. Netscape Navigator is available for UNIX.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="security"></a>Is security a problem if I use a public
workstation?</h3>

<p>Yes. Web browsers cache information and create a history file on the local workstation.
This allows a subsequent user of the workstation to access the system under your name
using the browser's Back button to recall a page from the cache, or by finding a page with
your personal information in the browser's history file. If you are concerned about the
security of your interlibrary loan requests, you can take the following steps:</p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table border="0" width="80%">
  <tr>
    <td><ol>
      <li>Access&nbsp; ILLiad only from your personal computer or an otherwise secure workstation.</li>
      <li>Access ILLiad from a public workstation in the Interlibrary Loan office in the library.
        These computers are supervised by the library staff.</li>
      <li>When using a public access workstation:<ul>
          <li>Delete from the history file those pages that contain your personal information.</li>
          <li>Exit from the Web browser before you leave the workstation. This prevents the Back
            button from accessing the pages you were using.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center></div>

<hr>

<h3><a name="history"></a>Why don't I see all my older requests
when I look at my request history?</h3>

<p>From time to time we purge older records from ILLiad. Our policy is to keep
requests online for several years in order to comply with record keeping requirements
of the copyright law.</p>

<h5><a href="#contents" target="_self">Back to Top</a></h5>

<hr>

<h3><a name="electronic"></a>What is electronic delivery?</h3>

<p>Many libraries ship photocopies of articles to us in electronic format. In the past we
printed these articles before delivering them to you. Now, through ILLiad, we are able to
offer you the option of electronic delivery of these articles in PDF format (Adobe's
Portable Document Format). You can read more about electronic delivery on the <a href="ElectronicDeliveryInformation.html">Electronic Delivery
Information page</a>.</p>

<hr>



<h3><a name="cookie"></a>Why does my browser say
that you're sending a cookie? What's in it?</h3>

<p>The Active Server Pages technology that we use to provide live reporting for the web
sends a Session ID to be stored on your machine. You can refuse this cookie and still be
able to use the ILL web pages and&nbsp; ILLiad without any problems.</p>
