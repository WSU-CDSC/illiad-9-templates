<h3><a name="what"></a>What is ILLiad?</a></h3>

<p>ILLiad is the electronic system you use to request an item through Access Services interlibrary 
  loan. The name ILLiad can be thought of as an acronym for <strong><u>I</u></strong>nter<strong><u>L</u></strong>ibrary 
  <strong><u>L</u></strong>oan <strong><u>i</u></strong>nternet <strong><u>a</u></strong>ccessible 
  <strong><u>d</u></strong>atabase. WSU Pullman affiliates away from Pullman use 
  the ILLiad request forms for all research material needs that cannot be met 
  by requesting loaned material through Griffin or <a href="http://128.223.84.85/">Summit</a>.

<h3><a name="better"></a>How is ILLiad better than traditional ILL systems?</h3>

<ol>
  <li>You will find it easier to submit your interlibrary loan requests. With ILLiad, you
    enter your name, address, and other personal information into the system only once, when you <a href="logon.html">initially logon to ILLiad
    using your WSU Network ID and password</a>.</li>
  <li>You are logging into a secure environment.</li>
  <li>Your request will be handled more rapidly and accurately as problems relating to
    misinterpretation of hand-written requests are eliminated.</li>
  <li>You can get many of your photocopies more quickly through Electronic
    Delivery.</li>
  <li>You can get information about the status of your request through the web at any time
    from any location simply by <a href="logon.html">logging on to ILLiad</a>. </li>
  <li>Library personnel are able to serve you better because all data about your request and
    its handling is stored in a searchable database. We are able to respond quickly to your
    inquiries about your request. We are also able to gather statistical information about the
    performance of the libraries that lend to us, enabling us to make better decisions when
    choosing a lender to supply an item.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="disadvantage"></a>Are there any disadvantages to the
electronic system?</h3>

<p>Some people might find it troublesome to have to log into ILLiad using their WSU Network ID and
password. We believe this is less trouble than traditional paper and electronic systems
which require you to enter your personal information with each new request.</p>

<h5><a href="#contents" target="_self">Back to Top</a></h5>

<hr>

<h3><a name="userid"></a>Why do I need my WSU Network ID and password to use
ILLiad?</h3>

<p>By using your existing WSU Network ID and password, you don't have to remember yet another
username & password to access information about your interlibrary loan requests. You can also edit your personal information
such as your address or phone number in this secure environment. </p>

<h5><a href="#contents" target="_self">Back to Top</a></h5>

<hr>

<h3><a name="password"></a>What if I forget my password?</h3>

<p>In the event that you forget your WSU Network ID password, please contact the ITS Help Desk at (509) 335-HELP (4357). 
They can reset your WSU Network ID password, they cannot tell you your current password. 
NOTE: This will change your WSU Network ID password which will affect everything you log into
(myWSU, payroll, etc.) not just for the Libraries ILLiad system.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="webbrowser"></a>What web browser should I use?</h3>

<p>You need a web browser that can handle forms, tables, and, preferably, one that can
handle frames.&nbsp; We recommend
Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.0 or greater or Firefox 3.0 or greater. 
Both browsers are available for the Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP/Vista and
Macintosh O/S operating systems. Firefox is available for Linux systems.</p>

<h5><a href="#contents" target="_self">Back to Top</a></h5>

<hr>

<h3><a name="security"></a>Is security a problem if I use a public
workstation?</h3>

<p>Yes. Web browsers cache information and create a history file on the local workstation.
This allows a subsequent user of the workstation to access the system under your name
using the browser's Back button to recall a page from the cache, or by finding a page with
your personal information in the browser's history file. If you are concerned about the
security of your interlibrary loan requests, you can take the following steps:</p>

<table border="0" width="80%">
  <tr>
    <td><ol>
      <li>Access ILLiad only from your personal computer or an otherwise secure workstation.</li>
      <li>When using a public access workstation:<ul>
      	<li>Delete from the history file those pages that contain your personal information.</li>
      	<li>Close the web browser completely (all instances) before you leave the workstation. This prevents the Back
            button from accessing the pages you were using.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3><a name="history"></a>Why don't I see all my older requests
when I look at my request history?</h3>

<p>From time to time we purge older records from ILLiad. Our policy is to keep
requests online for several years in order to comply with record keeping requirements
of the copyright law.</p>

<h5><a href="#contents" target="_self">Back to Top</a></h5>

<hr>

<h3><a name="electronic"></a>What is electronic delivery?</h3>

<p>Many libraries ship photocopies of articles to us in electronic format. In the past we
printed these articles before delivering them to you. Now, through ILLiad, we are able to
offer you the option of electronic delivery of these articles in PDF format (Adobe's
Portable Document Format). You can read more about electronic delivery on the <a href="ElectronicDeliveryInformation.html">Electronic Delivery
Information page</a>.</p>

<h5><a href="#contents" target="_self">Back to Top</a></h5>

<hr>

<h3><a name="cookie"></a>Why does my browser say
that you're sending a cookie? What's in it?</h3>

<p>The Active Server Pages technology that we use to provide live reporting for the web
sends a Session ID to be stored on your machine. You can refuse this cookie and still be
able to use the ILL web pages and ILLiad without any problems.</p>
