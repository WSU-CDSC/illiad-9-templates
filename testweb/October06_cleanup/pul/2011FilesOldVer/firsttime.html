    <p>To request an item through Interlibrary Loan, you must
    first identify yourself to the library's ILLiad system. To do
    this you fill out a registration form using your Web browser.
    Registration has three purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Entering your personal information into the ILLiad system means you will not have to supply the
            information again when making future requests.</li>
        <li>Having your e-mail and regular mail addresses on file
            with Interlibrary Loan enables us to notify you
            promptly and deliver materials accurately when your
            request arrives in the library. </li>
        <li>By specifying a Username and Password of your
            choosing, you will have secure access to information
            about your requests. You will also be able to review
            the list of items you have requested in the past.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><font face="Arial">About your Username and Password</font></h2>
    <p>During registration, you will be asked to choose a
    Username and Password. You will use this Username and
    Password when logging on to the ILLiad system in the future.</p>

            <td valign="top"><p align="left">Choose anything you
            like. You may use your Griffin PIN as your ILLiad password.
		Good security practice recommends, however, that you 
            choose a password that is different from
            those you use to access other systems. ILLiad will
            encrypt your password, so it will remain secure. Only
            you will know your password. </p>
